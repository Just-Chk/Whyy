"Gaming for Cause" is all about playing games that can promote any social cause. This game promotes the upliftment of women in society. This game occurs around a girl who was a little different from everyone. From a very little age, she was very curious and asks so many question. She was also a keen learner from childhood. When she became adult, she leaves her parents' house and stood up on her feet. She was often disregarded for being a woman and having the knowledge. Then one day, she got an opportunity to prove her worthiness in the society by getting an invitation by the king. He wanted to collect all the knowledge in books, so he invited all the scholars. She went for the invitation, showed her knowledge and in the end made an impact on the people.
